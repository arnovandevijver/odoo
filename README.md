# UI/UX Designer Exercise - Odoo

## Variant A

```
npm install
```

## Variant B

## Variant C

## Variant D

You will find a [UX report](./ux-report.md) in the root of the project.

# Oh no! Iâ€™m stuck!

As I don't have experience with Bootstrap, I must admit I faced some challenges while completing the exercise. The result of exercise "A" is functional, but I am not fully satisfied with it, as it doesn't completely match the requested design. I chose to use npm to install Bootstrap for the project, which allowed me to access the SCSS variables and customize Bootstrap components without writing any custom CSS or JavaScript, in line with the guidelines.

To better showcase my technical skills, I also decided to create a second version of the exercise using the technologies I'm most comfortable with:

- HTML (without Bootstrap classes or components)
- SCSS (with custom variables, mixins, and functions)
- JavaScript (without any frameworks)

In this version, I applied the design changes requested in exercise "B" and incorporated elements from my [UX report](./ux-report.md) to improve the user experience.

I'm available if you have any questions or need clarification regarding these two versions.
